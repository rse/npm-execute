Abstract
--------

This is a tiny [Node](https://nodejs.org/) module for cross-platform
executing Node Package Manager (NPM) from within Node. It especially
works-around the problem that under Windows executing a `*.cmd` script
from within Node requires a longer time to proceed.

Installation
------------

```sh
$ npm install npm-execute
```

Usage
-----

```js
const npmExecute = require("npm-execute")

npmExecute([ "root", "-g" ]).then((result) => {
    console.log(`npm root -g: ${result.stdout}`)
})

npmExecute([ "config", "get", "proxy" ]).then((result) => {
    console.log(`npm config get proxy: ${result.stdout}`)
})
```
